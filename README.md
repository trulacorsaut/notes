# 2023-12-29
- Today's programming wisdom is: "Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication. Write code that is easy to understand and maintain. Complex code may seem impressive at first, but it often leads to bugs, maintenance nightmares, and difficulty in collaboration. Remember, you write code not only for the computer to execute but also for other developers to read and comprehend. So, strive for clarity and conciseness in your code, and embrace the power of abstraction and modularization." 

In short, "Keep it simple, stupid" (KISS principle) and "You aren't gonna need it" (YAGNI principle) are timeless guidelines in software development.
