- Today's programming wisdom: "Premature optimization is the root of all evil." - Donald Knuth

In fewer than 200 words, this quote by computer scientist Donald Knuth emphasizes that focusing on optimizing code too early in the development process can lead to unnecessary complexity, harder maintenance, and potential misdirection from more critical design issues. It reminds programmers to first ensure their code is correct, clear, and functional before refining for performance. Understanding when to optimize is as important as knowing how to do it.
